# Data-science

##Data science project with python

This data science project analyzes the performance and characteristics of various electric cars using a dataset with information on 103 models. The dataset includes attributes such as brand, model, acceleration, top speed, range, efficiency, fast charge capability, powertrain, plug type, body style, seats, and price. The project involves reading the dataset, filtering for specific brands like Tesla, and performing statistical analysis. Key metrics such as acceleration, top speed, and range are summarized. Visualizations highlight relationships between attributes, such as price versus acceleration and efficiency versus charging time. The project concludes with a bar chart showcasing the most popular car body styles and brands in the dataset, emphasizing the prevalence of SUVs and the dominance of Tesla
